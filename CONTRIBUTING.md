  Merge only `dev` with this branch via pull requests
- `dev` - development branch, merge your branches with it via pull requests ([deployed here](https://pacifi5t.github.io/fp-js/dev))
- `gh-pages` - only for deployments, managed automatically
- _Other branches_ - those a created for each task/bugfix. See [branch naming](#branch-naming) to avoid misunderstandings and unnecessary questions
